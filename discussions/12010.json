You have to remove attributes from your code and get non-attributed ATL Server code that used to be injected by the compiler. To do this, recompile your code with /FX with the current version of compiler you are using. Here is more information about what /FX does - http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d8ex062w(VS.80).aspx. After compiler generated .mrg files, make a backup copy of your old source files and replace them with .mrg. files generated by /FX build. Rebuild your app with the current version of Visual Studio and make sure everything works as expected. Then port the code to Orcas and version of ATL Server from this project. You can comment out attributes now and Orcas compiler should build new source just fine. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Nikola<br />",

    "Html": "\r\nThank you very much for your exaustive reply; we still have one trouble: since our ATL server code is not static, but is dynamically generated by parsing some other .cpp files (and the tool that creates this code is also distributed to our ISV partners), is there a way to invoke the Visual2005 attribute provider so as to hide all the plumbing code generation details to out partners? (for example via COM calls?)<br />Thank you again<br />Marco Perasso<br />",

    "Html": "\r\nI am not exactly sure what you are asking. If my reading is correct, you have your own tool that generates cpp code with ATL Server attributes and you want to use compiler to unroll those attributes. Unfortunately you cannot call into the compiler to do that. However it is quite deterministic what code compiler injects for an attribute. I have not looked into details fo this, but I have a feeling that it should not be hard to directly generate non-attributed cpp code from your tool. This is the best solution I can think of at this moment. I would try this first before thinking of a more complex solution.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Nikola <br />",
