Within the services we have used ATL Server Mem Manager to allocate memory for the&nbsp;web service params&nbsp;which\r\n needs to be returned to the client. (e.g: &#65279;&#65279;&#65279;GetMemMgr()-&gt;Allocate(size) ). Now the question is can be used for local variables used within the context of web service implementation?. Also the freeing of this memory shall happen automatically?</p>\r\n<p>Any help in this regard is appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in Advance,</p>\r\n<p>Sujith</p>\r\n",
