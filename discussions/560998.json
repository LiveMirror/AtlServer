This can be accomplished through the IIS gui or by using appcmd. If you are using legacy libraries (such as ATL71.dll) make sure they are in the syswow64 folder.</li>\n<li>The &lt;APPISOLATION&gt;2&lt;/APPISOLATION&gt; node in the deployment .xml file should be like this (isolated)</li>\n<li>vcdeploy automatically creates the handlers for you in IIS7.5. They have some obscure name like AboMapperCustom-12xxxx</li>\n<li>If you plan on hosting more than 1 atl server app per site, you will need to delete the second AboMapperCustom-1xxx handler (which vcdeploy automatically creates) and manually create an isapi handler using the gui.</li>\n<li>Don't forget to edit the script map so that you give your Isapi execute permissions.</li>\n<li>Don't forget to map your application to the correct application pool in the basic settings section of the IIS7.5 gui</li>\n<li>Also don't forget to set the Isapi and CGI Restrictions to Allowed for each Isapi</li>\n<li>using icacls, set read and execute permissions on your dll's for the app pool</li>\n</ul>\n",
