I've downloaded the Source Code of the project.<br>\r\nHow can I use it with VC 2008? I mean there were a couple of Masters creating all that .srf, .h, .cpp template files and deploying .dlls.<br>\r\nSo, in what way can I do it? If the only possible way is manual, can you post an example?<br>\r\nThank you for help.<br>\r\n",
