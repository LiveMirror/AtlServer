And I have adapted the \"SOAPing without a Web Server\" By Bogdan CRIVAT published on the code project site to support HTTP.sys API.<br />So I'm wondering since this an \"Open Source\" project, and Bogdan was one of the creators of ATL Server, why not reuse that code and incorporate it into ATL Server?<br /><br />Also another idea that comes to mind, is maybe to think of an integration layer with gSOAP. Since this is a library that already supports some of the WS-* standards?<br /><br />Regards<br />Cláudio Albuquerque<br />",

I've submitted patched to gSOAP in the past, so I'm acquainted with the code.  If help is needed, I can provide a bit.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Travis Spencer<br />",
