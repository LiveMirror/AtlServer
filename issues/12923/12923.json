    "Description": "In the atlsmtpconnection.h file, the global variable declaration \"__declspec(selectany) CSMTPWSAStartup _g_smtp_init;\" calls \"WSAStartup(ATLSMTP_WSA_VERSION, &wsadata)\" in its constructor (see init() method).\nThis violates the rule that we may not call imported functions other than those located in Kernel32.dll (see \"DllMain Restrictions\" section at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa290048%28VS.71%29.aspx).\n \nPossible solutions (IMHO):\n1) remove the init() call from the constructor of CSMTPWSAStartup\n2) wrap the _g_smtp_init object in a songleton\n \nNote:\nBecause of this issue, we had a crash when the DLLS were loaded (DllMain) -> hard to diagnose & debug. DLL Delay Load (in Visual Studio) helped, but it isn't a \"real\" solution...",
