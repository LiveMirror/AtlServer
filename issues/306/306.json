    "ClosedComment": "Hi,\n\nAtlRx.h is included. We had issue with source code, which we had to re-construct last week. Check out the new release, http://www.codeplex.com/AtlServer/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx.  \n\nThere are any current plans on including core ATL parts to this project. ATL is going to continue shipping with Visual C++. It may change in future if there is a strong customer demand on shipping ATL as shared source project. \n\nThanks,\nNikola",
