    "Description": "SPROXY generates an instance of the header type for each method that uses that header, even if all headers are of the same type. (The C# proxy generator just generates one, called \"<typename>Value\".) The real problem though, is that they're named \"_<typename>[counter]\", so that it's very difficult to tell which instance corresponds to which method. Also, since the list of headers is maintained in a hash map keyed by a pointer, the correspondence is not stable (it's essentially random), so client code will likely be subtly broken when the header is regenerated due to mismatched headers.\nGiven my FooWebService with 7 methods that have a header of type FooHeader, SPROXY generates the following:\n \ntemplate <typename TClient = CSoapSocketClientT<> >\nclass CFooWebServiceT : \n public TClient, \n public CSoapRootHandler\n{\npublic:\n //\n // SOAP headers\n //\n \n FooHeader _FooHeader1;\n FooHeader _FooHeader2;\n FooHeader _FooHeader4;\n FooHeader _FooHeader;\n FooHeader _FooHeader3;\n FooHeader _FooHeader0;\n FooHeader _FooHeader5;\n // ...\n};\nIf SPROXY were to behave like the C# proxy generator, it would generate the following, where FooHeaderValue is shared by all methods:\ntemplate <typename TClient = CSoapSocketClientT<> >\nclass CFooWebServiceT : \n public TClient, \n public CSoapRootHandler\n{\npublic:\n //\n // SOAP headers\n //\n \n FooHeader FooHeaderValue;\n // ...\n};",
