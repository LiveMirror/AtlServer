    "Description": "If a binary file is being downloaded using chunked Transfer-Encoding, and the binary file contains a null character, this line in ReadChunkedBody will only append some of the result_buffer to m_current, because Append with no length uses strlen, which will stop at the null. Later attempts to use m_current can cause access violations because GetBodyLength() still returns the actual download size.\n\tif (!m_current.Append((LPCSTR)result_buffer))\n\t\treturn false;\n \nChanging it to this, fixes the problem:\n\tif ( !m_current.Append((LPCSTR)result_buffer, result_buffer.GetLength()) )\n\t\treturn false;\n \n \nNot a bug, but I also added this code in ReadChunkedBody just after a successful Read so that callback clients will get feedback during a chunked download.\n                if (m_pNavData->pfnReadStatusCallback)\n                {\n\t\t\t\t    bool bRet = m_pNavData->pfnReadStatusCallback(dwReadBuffSize, m_pNavData->m_lParamRead);\n\t\t\t        if (!bRet)\n\t\t\t\t        return bRet;\n                }",
