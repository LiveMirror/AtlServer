I believe that this is the result of a problem inside RegQueryValueEx, by including uninitialized data into the reported byte array. As with other uninitialized data, reproducing the problem is quite random.\r\nI have submitted the issue via Microsoft Connect (https://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/633595/a-possible-problem-in-winapi-function-regqueryvalueex-prevents-perf-counter-registration#)\r\n\r\nA simple workaround may be coded into ATL Server, <atlperf.inl>:\r\nMetods CPerfMon::_AppendRegStrings and CPerfMon::_RemoveRegStrings should zero-fill the buffer inside CStrBuf passed as a parameter to the second calls to rkLang.QueryMultiStringValue.\r\n",
